The U.S. Senate just voted to gut online privacy rules and allow Internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T to sell your sensitive personal information to advertisers without your permission. Lobbyists from the marketing and telecom industries are pushing hard on the members of Congress who they make large campaign contributions to and the House of Representatives is expected to vote on this on Tuesday, March 28th. **We still have a chance to stop this in the House. Call Congress right now. Tell them to vote NO on repealing the FCC broadband privacy rules: (415) 360-0555**

HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

: Last year, the FCC passed landmark regulations that strengthen online privacy rights. Now, Congress wants to undo them, using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows Congress 60 days to review a new law before it goes into effect. This could allow ISPs to store and sell our every move and detail.

IRREVERSIBLE MEANS IRREVERSIBLE, PERIOD

:	The CRA not only allows Congress to overturn rules with a simple majority vote. It also **prevents the agency from issuing the same regulation in the future**. If this happens, it's the beginning of the end of digital privacy.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

:	This isn't just your browsing history or cookies. It's geolocation data, financial info, passwords, health info, even your Social Security Number. Anything you do, any data you enter, any online video you watch, any email you write. Your ISP could store it all and sell it for their own profit if Congress throws out the FCC rulings.
