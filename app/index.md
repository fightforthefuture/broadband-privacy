Your internet provider wants to track, package, and sell your internet self. All your data, actions, even your SSN. Last year, the FCC passed regulations to protect your internet privacy rights. Now, some members of Congress are trying to use the Congressional Review Act (CPA) to put our personal data back on the production line. **Contact Congress now and tell them to delay the CPA before you’re boxed in for good.**

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?

: ####Unless you take action, your private information will be a new product for your ISP. Irreversibly.

: 	####We have until July 6th.

	On March 31st, the FCC voted in favor of releasing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (called an 'NPRM') on <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-16-39A1.pdf">Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services</a> to ensure consumers have the tools they need to make informed choices about how and whether their data is used and shared by their broadband providers.

A RIGHT TO CHOICE

:	You should have a say in how your personal details are handled or sold. Any use of your data other than what's necessary for providing broadband service or marketing the service you've purchased would require permission - either with an explicit opt-in or in some instances, an opt-out.
{: .explainer-last}


A RIGHT TO TRANSPARENCY

:	You deserve to know what information broadband providers collect about you, how they use it, and that it’s being handled and maintained securely. The proposal includes security breach notification requirements, including timeframes for notifying customers, the FCC, FBI, and US Secret Service.
{: .explainer-last}


A RIGHT TO SECURITY

: Broadband providers have a responsibility to protect your data. The proposal would require them to take reasonable steps within their organization to safeguard customer information, including adopting risk management practices and identifying a senior manager responsible for data security.
