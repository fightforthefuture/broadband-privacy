Last year, the FCC passed rules to stop companies like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T from spying on your online activity to sell to advertisers for profit. But now, Comcast's friends in Congress are trying to gut these rules. **If they win, every US Internet service provider (ISP) will be able to spy on you and sell your online habits to advertisers, without your permission. Congress is expected to vote on this on Thursday, March 23, 2017. Call Congress now to stop them!**

HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

: Last year, the FCC passed landmark regulations that strengthen online privacy rights. Now, Congress wants to undo them, using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows Congress 60 days to review a new law before it goes into effect. This could allow ISPs to store and sell our every move and detail.

IRREVERSIBLE MEANS IRREVERSIBLE, PERIOD

:	The CRA not only allows Congress to overturn rules with a simple majority vote. It also **prevents the agency from issuing the same regulation in the future**. If this happens, it's the beginning of the end of digital privacy.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

:	This isn't just your browsing history or cookies. It's geolocation data, financial info, passwords, health info, even your Social Security Number. Anything you do, any data you enter, any online video you watch, any email you write. Your ISP could store it all and sell it for their own profit if Congress throws out the FCC rulings.
