Congress just repealed Internet privacy rules, allowing Internet service providers like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon to monitor, track, and sell your personal data without your permission. Now, the administration wants to give these same companies even more power. The new Chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, is planning to kill net neutrality protections that prevent ISPs from slowing down or censoring websites. If they succeed, the Internet will never be the same.

HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

: Last year, the FCC passed landmark regulations that strengthen online privacy rights. Now, Congress wants to undo them, using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows Congress 60 days to review a new law before it goes into effect. This could allow ISPs to store and sell our every move and detail.

IRREVERSIBLE MEANS IRREVERSIBLE, PERIOD

:	The CRA not only allows Congress to overturn rules with a simple majority vote. It also **prevents the agency from issuing the same regulation in the future**. If this happens, it's the beginning of the end of digital privacy.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

:	This isn't just your browsing history or cookies. It's geolocation data, financial info, passwords, health info, even your Social Security Number. Anything you do, any data you enter, any online video you watch, any email you write. Your ISP could store it all and sell it for their own profit if Congress throws out the FCC rulings.
